Notes:

- cant select stuff is something before isnt sleected - MAX BOORDS

- Climbed the last 3 matches with a 43% climb average - MAX BOORD

auto advqnced
- %hit middle, middle last 3, 
- %hit side, side last 3 

whos best at middle whos best at side, if its same one whos second best

what autos each team should do

lright so heres my dream strategy sheet. normally made by a human but i wanna automate it next season


[8:39] 
(gonna use 2017 game to explain it) (edited)


[8:39] 
basically i want a 2, 3 and 4 rotor percentage based on normal distribution


[8:39] 
for both sides


[8:39] 
some kpa numbers


[8:40] 
something that takes that and figures out based on pit scouting and qualitative data how deffendable teams are and how good each alliance is at playing D


[8:41] 
and from that it spits out a 3+ D win percentage


[8:41] 
same with 4


[8:41] 
and the same with KPA


[8:42] 
and then shits out a graph on what should work best and by what statistical percentage


27 scouting:
scout lead every 5 matches updates local data

keep local data and when updating use QR code 




\if auto and teleop tasks are independent al la 2016, 2013 and 2012 idd just go with whatever gives max score

Idk what your system alows but essentially you want a z test


[10:22] 
You want to do a z test on a per robot basis for each catagory


[10:23] 
And for each point in that catagory you want to know the % chance of a robot completing the task


[10:24] 
Then you can make something to itterate through posibilities of each and find the minimum value of all the corrisponding z values for each possible combination.


[10:27] 
For instance, if im trying to 3 rotor and no one has autonomous, I need to do 6 gears. So logically I try to have each robot do 2 gears. The z test scores are .01, .05 and .89. Subtracted from 1 you get .99, .95 and .11. Then taking the minimum of those u get .11, or an 11% chance of strategic success with that combination.


[10:30] 
A better way to go would be to try to have a 3,2,1 combination.  The z scores might look like are .03, .05 and .50. Subtracted from 1 you get .97, .95 and .50. Then taking the minimum of those u get .50, or a 50% chance of strategic success with that combination. Idd much rather run that than the 1st option. You can then use subsiquent tests for climb times and such to determine if at the completion of each teams required gear cycling they go to climb or play climb deffense or some other action.


[10:34] 
Also worth noting I have no fucking clue what your system is capable of with reguards to inputs.


[10:35] 
Im doing some sort of fudge factor for the inverse percentage of number of matches completed so that the less data I have the less certain the predictions will say they are.


[10:36] 
Also im considering doing logrithmic or exponential scaling on the data to make more recent data increase in pertinence to the calculations.


[10:37] 
@brian62 @dirtbikerxz does any of this make the slightest bit of logical sense.


ONLY MAKE STUFF POPUT IF ITS POSSBLE IN THE MATCH PAGE
