[8:39] 
(gonna use 2017 game to explain it) (edited)

basically i want a 2, 3 and 4 rotor percentage based on normal distribution


[8:39] 
for both sides


[8:39] 
some kpa numbers


[8:40] 
something that takes that and figures out based on pit scouting and qualitative data how deffendable teams are and how good each alliance is at playing D


[8:41] 
and from that it spits out a 3+ D win percentage


[8:41] 
same with 4


[8:41] 
and the same with KPA


[8:42] 
and then shits out a graph on what should work best and by what statistical percentage
